## Phoenix
A social media application for people to create items for themselves to add to their own bucket list. 

## Motivation
Our motivation for this application was for people to be able to put all their bucket list items in one place because these types of things can be easily forgotten by most.
 
## Screenshots
A gif of a brief run-through of our application has been added in for reference and a quick overview of our application.
